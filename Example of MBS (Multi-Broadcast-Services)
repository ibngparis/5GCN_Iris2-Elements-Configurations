Multi/Broadcast Services

What is an example of a MBS use-case Iris2 can deploye
Below is a verified, technically accurate example of an MBS (Multicast/Broadcast Services) use-case that IRIS² can realistically deploy, based on what we know from:

SES technical presentation on 5G‑NTN multicast/broadcast challenges and uses
The IRIS² technical description confirming 5G NR NTN, regenerative RAN, and integration with 5GC
3GPP background on 5G MBS capabilities and their relevance for NTN scenarios

🚨 **Example MBS Use‑Case IRIS² Can Deploy: Nationwide (or EU‑wide) Emergency Alert Broadcast over 5G‑NTN**

This is one of the strongest, clearest, high‑impact MBS use‑cases for IRIS² because:

IRIS² offers multiorbit LEO/MEO coverage and 5G NR NTN waveforms.
5G‑NTN broadcast is highlighted as ideal for large-area, ubiquitous coverage.
3GPP states that broadcast/multicast is critical for public safety push alerts and large-scale information dissemination.
So IRIS² is perfectly aligned for this use‑case.

📡 Use-Case Description: Pan-European Emergency Messaging (MBS over IRIS²)
Scenario
Governments or EU agencies need to broadcast real-time alerts to citizens or critical operators across vast areas, even where terrestrial 5G coverage is poor or disrupted.

Examples:
Natural disasters (earthquakes, floods, forest fires)
Security incidents (terror alerts, civil protection notices)
Space weather or GNSS degradation warnings
Evacuation or safety instructions
Why IRIS² is ideal
Broadcast at scale over NTN
IRIS²’s 5G NR NTN infrastructure supports MBS where the same content must reach many UEs efficiently.

Ubiquitous coverage
LEO/MEO satellites provide pan-EU reach, including:

rural zones
mountains
maritime areas
in disaster zones where terrestrial infrastructure is damaged
5G MBS is explicitly designed for this
3GPP notes public safety communications as a primary MBS use-case.

IRIS² uses 5G NR NTN waveforms
Meaning broadcast content can be transmitted natively using 5G, without extra proprietary layers.
This is confirmed by IRIS² technical specs:

“5G NR NTN waveform in Ku and Ka bands”
“Fully integrated in 5G Core Network”

Flow Example
EU Authority → IRIS² Secure Ground Segment →  
5G Core MBS Application Server →  
NTN Regenerative RAN →  
LEO/MEO Satellites →  
UE multicast/broadcast reception
Even low-cost NTN‑capable handsets or IoT devices can receive such alerts.

🎯 Why this is a strong RFPv2-facing example
Because it:
aligns with governmental-secure communications (IRIS²’s primary mission)
uses native 5G MBS functionality
demonstrates a unique value vs terrestrial operators
leverages the broadcast efficiency of NTN networks highlighted by SES

🌍 Other possible IRIS² MBS use-cases (short list)
Based on the same sources:

1. Maritime or aeronautical safety information broadcasting
Mariners/aircraft receive:
meteorology updates
navigational warnings
SAR (search and rescue) notifications
(Consistent with NTN broadcast strengths.)

2. Firmware/Software multicast to connected devices
For fleets of:
IoT terminals
drones
sensors
maritime terminals

3. Live video multicasting for authorities
To distribute the same encrypted feed to many government receivers:
border surveillance
crisis management teams
remote intervention units

4. Education or public dissemination services
Broadcasting content to remote schools or communities with limited terrestrial connectivity (fits “broadcast suitable for large coverage” from SES).

### **Key 5GCN Contribution**

*   Enables **efficient, scalable content distribution** for millions of receivers across Europe.
*   Supports **dynamic switching** between unicast/multicast, a key NTN challenge cited by SES .

***

## 🚀 **2. NTN RAN (LEO/MEO Satellites + NTN Gateway)**

IRIS² includes a **regenerative 5G RAN in LEO and MEO**, using 5G NR NTN waveform in Ku/Ka bands, with full 5GC integration. [\[etsi.org\]](
https://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_ts/126500_126599/126502/17.00.00_60/ts_126502v170000p.pdf)

### **RAN Functions Involved:**

| NTN RAN Component                             | Role                                                                                                                                                                               |

| **Regenerative gNodeB on LEO/MEO satellites** | Efficient satellite‑based RAN handling MBS radio bearers                                                                                                                           |
| **Multicast/Broadcast Beam Management**       | Manages dynamic MBS coverage zones over large moving footprints                                                                                                                    |
| **NTN Gateway**                               | Handles N2/N3 signaling and transport between gNB and 5GCN                                                                                                                         |
| **Beam Handover Management**                  | Critical due to moving beams and feeder link variability—highlighted as a challenge for NTN MBS by SES  |

### **Why RAN Is Crucial**

*   Broadcast is ideal for satellite networks due to **large-area coverage** and efficient delivery of identical content to many UEs .
*   5G MBS requires NTN‑specific mechanisms for **satellite-to-satellite handover**, beam switching, and delay compensation—documented in SES’s 5G‑NTN analysis .

## 📊 **3. BSS (Business Support Systems)**

Although emergency alerts are not commercial services, the **BSS subsystem still participates**:

### **BSS Responsibilities in This Use‑Case:**

| Function                              | Role                                                                                       |
| ------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Service Entitlement & User Groups** | Some alerts may be targeted (e.g., governmental users, critical infrastructure operators). |
| **Operational Reporting**             | KPI tracking of alert reach, delivery success, per-beam analytics.                         |
| **Resource/Cost Allocation**          | For government or agency customers of IRIS² secure services.                               |

### **Why BSS Matters**

3GPP identifies broadcast/multicast as important for public safety and operator service efficiency; integrating MBS with customer-facing and operational systems is necessary for accountability 
and service-level monitoring. [\[key4biz.it\]](https://www.key4biz.it/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/iris2presentazione.pdf)

## 🔐 **4. Security Subsystems (HSM, KMF, GOVSATCOM Security Layer)**

Emergency broadcast requires **trusted origin authentication**, secure control plane, and controlled access.

### **Security Components Involved:**

| Component                              | Role                                                                          |
| -------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **KMF (Key Management Facility)**      | Signs or encrypts control messages authorizing MBS transmissions              |
| **HSM (within 5GCN)**                  | Protects MBS server keys, BM‑SC credentials, and signalling security          |
| **HSM (within Security Domain / KMF)** | Protects government-issued digital signatures for alert authenticity          |
| **Secure Ground Segment**              | Ensures trusted chain from authority → application layer → NTN infrastructure |

### **Security Relevance**

*   5G MBS requires secure **content origin authentication** to prevent false emergency alerts.
*   NTN introduces additional challenges (long propagation delays, beam mobility) requiring robust security integration (SES) .
