OVERLAP between OSS / IOPS in the IRIS2 5GCN 
Can you now provide a list of the exact data objects that must be uniquely owned

Absolutely — here is a precise, implementation‑ready list of data objects that must have a single, unique owner across OSS, IOPS, and Vendor.
This prevents duplication, conflicts, and ambiguous authority in 5GC/OSS/IOPS architectures.

I’ve structured the list into 7 domains:

Service & Resource Models
Inventory
Configuration (CM)
Policy & Intent
Subscriber / Identity
Telemetry (PM/FM/Logs/Traces)
Lifecycle & Deployment
For each object, I identify the required single owner (OSS vs IOPS vs Vendor).

✅ 1. Service & Resource Model Objects (must be uniquely owned)
These are architectural truth‑source objects that define how services and NFs are described.

Data Object	Must‑Own Owner	Why
Service Model (E2E service templates)	OSS	Ensures single service definition across domains.
Resource Model (NF + infra abstractions)	OSS	Needed for orchestration + inventory alignment.
Slice Templates (S‑NSSAI, QoS, topologies)	OSS	Centralized intent → avoids RAN/CN/transport mismatches.
Topology Graphs (relations between AMF–SMF–UPF etc.)	OSS	Only OSS sees cross‑domain relationships.
✅ 2. Inventory Objects (golden copies)
Data Object	Must‑Own Owner	Notes
Service Inventory (E2E services, configurations)	OSS	Authoritative view of live services.
Resource Inventory (NF instances, VNFs/CNFs, slices)	OSS	Vendors manage only runtime; OSS owns master view.
CI/PI Inventory (config items, versioning)	OSS	Needed for ITSM + rollback accuracy.
IP address pools / identifiers used for NFs	OSS	Prevents duplication in multi‑vendor cores.
✅ 3. Configuration Management (CM) Objects
Vendor provides schemas; OSS must own the applied configuration.
This is the most critical domain for single ownership.

Data Object	Must‑Own Owner	Notes
NF Configuration Data Models (YANG/Itf‑N profiles)	Vendor (Producer)	Vendor authors the schema.
Applied Configuration Sets (AMF/SMF/UPF/PCF etc.)	OSS	OSS is source of truth for active configs.
NF Parameter Catalog (defaults + allowed value ranges)	Vendor	Vendor defines allowed configuration space.
Configuration Version History / rollback objects	OSS	Needed for governance and reproducibility.
Certificates for Management Plane (TLS for OAM)	OSS/IOPS	Vendor can’t own operator trust domain.
✅ 4. Policy & Intent Objects
Data Object	Must‑Own Owner	Notes
Network Intent Objects (QoS, routing, slice intent, scaling intent)	OSS	All automation originates from OSS intent.
Closed‑loop Policies (KPI thresholds, triggers, RCA trees)	OSS	Cross‑domain; vendor cannot own.
PCF Policy Rule Sets (top‑level definitions)	OSS	Vendor owns runtime execution, not the policy truth.
AI/ML Models for assurance-based actions	OSS	Vendor may supply features; ownership stays operator-side.
✅ 5. Subscriber / Identity Objects
These are the strictest in terms of ownership.

Data Object	Must‑Own Owner	Notes
Subscriber Profiles (UDM data)	IOPS	Operator legally holds subscriber identity.
Authentication Objects (keys, seeds, AUSF/UDM secrets)	IOPS	Vendor must not own cryptographic identity.
Exposure Policies for NEF	OSS	Cross‑domain governance + compliance.
✅ 6. Telemetry (FM/PM/Logs/Traces) Objects
Vendor emits; OSS owns collection and lifecycle.

Data Object	Must‑Own Owner	Notes
Performance Measurement Catalog (KPI definitions)	Vendor	Vendor defines counters.
Collected Performance Metrics (PM files, streams)	OSS	Single analytics data lake ingestion.
Fault/Alarm Object Models (alarm types, severity mapping)	Vendor	Vendor defines alarm semantics.
Correlated Alarms (post‑correlation events)	OSS	OSS assurance engine creates these.
Logs + Traces (OTel, VES, syslog etc.)	OSS	Vendor cannot store operator logs long‑term.
✅ 7. Lifecycle & Deployment Objects
Data Object	Must‑Own Owner	Notes
NF Software Images (binaries)	Vendor	Only vendor can produce these.
Deployment Manifests (Helm charts, Operators, CNF packages)	Vendor	Vendor controls lifecycle logic.
Instantiation Parameters (override YAMLs/intents)	OSS	Operator must own overrides applied at deploy time.
Upgrade Plans / Execution Graphs	OSS	Vendor supplies instructions, not execution ownership.
Observability Pipelines (collection, enrichment, storage)	OSS	Telemetry governance must be centralized.

✅ A table ready for governance documents
✅ A machine‑readable YAML/JSON version for automation pipelines
