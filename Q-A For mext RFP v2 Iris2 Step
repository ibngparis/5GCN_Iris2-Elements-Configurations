Here is a **clean, RFP‑ready Q\&A package** built directly from your gap analysis.  
It is written in a **question–answer format**, exactly as typically used in RFP Clarification Rounds.

***

# 📌 **IRIS² – T‑Systems RFP Clarification Package (Q\&A Format)**

**For Next Clarification Round**

This package structures each technical gap into **precise questions** to T‑Systems and provides **expected outcomes**, so you can drive the discussion and ensure commitments are explicit, binding, and measurable.

***

# 🔴 **1. Mandatory Network Functions Missing**

## **Q1 — Multicast/Broadcast Service (MBS) Support**

**Question:**  
The TS mandates MBSF, MB‑SMF, and CBCF for Multicast/Broadcast (TS Table 6 & §7.8.x). Your proposal lists these as “not offered.”  
**Can you confirm whether MBS support will be delivered, and if so, provide a delivery roadmap, maturity level, and commercial impact?**

**Expected Outcome:**

*   Confirm whether MBS will be supported at all
*   Provide a delivery commitment (date) or explicit exclusion
*   Clarify whether development is required and who funds it

***

## **Q2 — NSACF Availability**

**Question:**  
NSACF is listed as mandatory for future slicing evolution (TS §7.1.1). You have stated NSACF is not offered.  
**Do you plan to support NSACF in future releases? If yes, specify version/timelines; if not, provide justification.**

**Expected Outcome:**

*   Clear Yes/No
*   Timeline for inclusion (if yes)
*   Commercial/technical impact of non-support

***

# 🔴 **2. TMF API Requirements Not Met**

## **Q3 — Full TMF API Coverage**

**Question:**  
TS §7.3 mandates a full set of TMF APIs (e.g., 641, 638, 639, 640, 652, 634, 642, 628, 657, 653, 656, 667).  
Your proposal indicates partial support and non‑TMF interfaces for DBB.  
**Please provide a complete list of TMF APIs you will support, including delivery dates, maturity levels, and any deviations from TS requirements.**

**Expected Outcome:**

*   Detailed TMF API compliance matrix
*   Confirmation whether DBB–5GMP integration will be TMF-based
*   Required customizations (if any)

***

# 🔴 **3. UPF Placement & Geo‑Redundancy Misalignment**

## **Q4 — UPF Deployment at GCCs**

**Question:**  
The TS requires UPF deployments both at Gateways (GW) and GCCs for geo‑redundancy and survivability.  
Your proposal restricts UPFs to GW locations only.  
**Will you support UPF placement in GCCs? If yes, provide the required architectural changes and timeline.**

**Expected Outcome:**

*   Yes/No confirmation
*   Architectural diagram update
*   Session continuity behaviour (PFCP redundancy, state sync)

***

## **Q5 — Geo‑Redundant User Plane Support**

**Question:**  
Your proposal states that geo‑redundant session continuity is not supported.  
**Can you confirm whether this feature will be delivered, and if so, provide technical details on UPF failover behaviour and state replication?**

**Expected Outcome:**

*   Clear commitment
*   Failover timing (RTO) & data loss tolerance (RPO)
*   Required licenses/add-ons

***

# 🔥 **4. NTN Scaling Requirements Not Confirmed**

## **Q6 — Quantitative NTN Scalability Compliance**

**Question:**  
TS §6.5 defines explicit capacity requirements (e.g., \~40k cells, \~6k cells/CU, \~10k TAs).  
Your proposal does not provide any numerical commitments.  
**Please provide confirmed NF capacity benchmarks for AMF/SMF/UDM/NRF aligned to IRIS² NTN scaling requirements.**

**Expected Outcome:**

*   Verified dimensioning numbers
*   Benchmark methodology
*   Restrictions and bottlenecks

***

## **Q7 — NTN Mobility & Paging Performance**

**Question:**  
NTN mobility pattern generates extreme HO rates and paging loads.  
**Can you provide performance metrics (HOs/min, paging throughput) and validate that your 5GCN can handle IRIS² NTN mobility characteristics?**

**Expected Outcome:**

*   Numerical performance envelope
*   Stress-test reports
*   Any required NF clustering limits

***

# 🔥 **5. Subscriber Identity (I2SID)**

## **Q8 — I2SID Functional & Data Model Support**

**Question:**  
I2SID is mandatory for UDM/UDR/Provisioning (TS §6.3). You list this as Open Topic #1.  
**Can you confirm full I2SID support across UDR, UDM, CHF, PCF, and all provisioning workflows, including schema changes?**

**Expected Outcome:**

*   Yes/No response
*   Required changes to DB schema/API
*   Timeline + testing implications

***

# 🔥 **6. Charging, CDR & Offline Support**

## **Q9 — CDR Format, Fields, Protocol & Delivery**

**Question:**  
The TS requires TS 32.xxx‑compliant CDRs, delivered securely to DBB via TMF-family APIs.  
Your offer includes only partial offline charging and marks CDR delivery protocol as “open topic.”  
**Please confirm full compliance to TS 32.xxx, including CDR schema, export protocol, and TMF‑compliant DBB ingestion.**

**Expected Outcome:**

*   Full CDR field list
*   Transport protocol (TLS, FTPS, TMF APIs?)
*   Support for offline/online charging completeness

***

# 🟡 **7. EIR Status**

## **Q10 — Mandatory Inclusion of 5G-EIR**

**Question:**  
TS mandates a 5G‑EIR.  
Your proposal offers it only optionally.  
**Can you confirm whether EIR will be included in the baseline? If not, explain the technical limitations and pricing impact.**

**Expected Outcome:**

*   Inclusion as mandatory NF
*   Or formal exclusion with rationale
*   Effects on PEI validation flows

***

# 🟡 **8. UDSF Deployment Model**

## **Q11 — Dedicated UDSF NF Availability**

**Question:**  
TS Table 6 lists UDSF as a distinct NF. You instead provide UDSF as embedded functionality across NFs.  
**Can you provide a dedicated UDSF option, and if yes, what is the architecture, scaling, and data persistence model?**

**Expected Outcome:**

*   Yes/No
*   Impact on AMF/SMF state-sharing
*   Data consistency guarantees

***

# 🟡 **9. SECMON & GNSS Interface Definition**

## **Q12 — Interface Specifications**

**Question:**  
Open Topics #6 and #7 request detail on SECMON and GNSS interfaces.  
TS §21 considers them mandatory external interfaces.  
**Please provide interface specifications, security model, and supported protocols for SECMON and GNSS integration.**

**Expected Outcome:**

*   Interface definitions
*   Whether configuration is pull/push
*   Certificates, authentication, and transport details

***

# 🟡 **10. IPSec Gateways**

## **Q13 — IPSec Support for NG Interfaces**

**Question:**  
TS §7.5 mandates IPSec protection for NG interfaces.  
Your proposal excludes external security solutions.  
**Will IPSec gateways be provided, or must IRIS² procure them separately? If provided, specify throughput, HA, and supported cipher suites.**

**Expected Outcome:**

*   Clear delivery responsibility
*   Technical specs
*   Integration details

***

# 🟡 **11. SSC Modes**

## **Q14 — Support for SSC Modes 2 & 3**

**Question:**  
Your Open Topic #15 indicates only SSC Mode 1 is supported, whereas TS requires SSC1/2/3 for continuity.  
**Do you plan to support SSC2 & SSC3, and if yes, when?**

**Expected Outcome:**

*   Confirm support plan
*   Session continuity behaviour
*   Timeline for feature activation

***

# 🟢 **12. Non‑Critical Clarifications**

## **Q15 — S1000D Documentation Format**

Confirm whether S1000D documentation can be provided and by which release.

## **Q16 — IVV Perimeter**

Clarify assumptions regarding the IVV-level security boundaries.

## **Q17 — Emulator Acceptance**

Define what level of emulator fidelity you provide and what TS requirements it covers.

# 📌 **Would you like this packaged as a PDF, Word, or RFP submission template?**

I can also generate:  
✅ a **cover letter**,  
✅ a **RFP escalation matrix**, or  
✅ a **negotiation script** for the clarification meeting.
